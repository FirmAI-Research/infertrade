\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
MACD = EMA(t_{1}) - EMA(t_{2})
\end{equation}

$\position_\currenttime$: is the portfolio allocation at time $\currenttime$

$R_t$: Research value at time $\currenttime$

$R_{t-1}$: Research value at time $\currenttime -1$

$k_1$: level coefficient

$k_2$: static coefficient
