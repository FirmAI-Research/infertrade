\ruledescription{A regression based approach to forecast price change in asset using signals generated from technical indicators.}

\howtotrade
{Any of the available technical indicators can be used as signal to forecast price change in asset. Usually a technical indicator is used to find the strength or weakness of a stock price. \\ \\ As an example we can consider Money Flow Index. MFI indicator is a momentum indicator which varies between 0 and 100 and is used to define an overbought and oversold conditions. Usually MFI value above 80 is considered overbought and a sell signal is generated while a value below 20 is considered oversold and a buy signal is generated.\\ \\
By using this trading strategy we compute the MFI of underlying asset using it's historical High, Low, Close \& Volume. Instead of using the MFI value to generate buy/sell signal as explained above, a forecast is made for expected change in price using MFI as a signal governed by Equation \ref{eqn:SignalRegression}. $\beta$ coefficient determines the relationship and impact of Signal $S$ on change in price of asset $\Delta \price$.\\ \\
Forecast generated as described above is then used to generate fractional portfolio investment using formulation mentioned in Equation \ref{eqn:portfolioallocation}.

\section{Equation}
Below is the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:SignalRegression}
\Delta \price_{\currenttime} = \beta \, S_{\currenttime-1} + c + \varepsilon_{\currenttime}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:portfolioallocation}
    \position_{\currenttime} = \kellyfraction \, \frac{E[\Delta \price_{\currenttime}]}{\sigma^{2}}
\end{equation}
\\
with:

$\Delta \price_{\currenttime}:$ is the change in asset price at time $\currenttime$.

$E[\Delta \price_{\currenttime}]$: is the expected change in price at time $\currenttime$.

$S_{\currenttime-1}$: is the signal value at time $\currenttime-1$.

$\beta$: is the relationship coefficient between $S_{\currenttime-1}$ and $E[\Delta \price_{\currenttime}]$.

$c$: is a constant bias.

$\varepsilon_{\currenttime}$: is the error term.

$\kellyfraction$: is the Kelly fraction.

$\position_{\currenttime}$: is the resultant fractional portfolio investment at time \currenttime.
