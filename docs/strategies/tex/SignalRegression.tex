\ruledescription{A regression based approach to forecast price change in asset using signals generated from technical indicators.}

\howtotrade
{Any of the available technical indicators can be used as signal to forecast price change in asset. As an example we can consider Money Flow Index. By using this trading strategy we compute the MFI of underlying asset using it's historical High, Low, Close \& Volume. A forecast is generated for change in price using MFI as a signal. The mathematical formulation for this particular example would be as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \price_{\currenttime} = MFI_{\currenttime-1} + c
\end{equation}

Forecast for the asset using above formulation is then used to generate fractional portfolio investment using formulation mentioned in Equation \ref{eqn:portfolioallocation}.

\section{Equation}
Below is the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
\Delta \price_{\currenttime} = S_{\currenttime-1} + c
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:portfolioallocation}
    \position_{\currenttime} = \kellyfraction \, \frac{\Delta \price_{\currenttime}}{\sigma^{2}}
\end{equation}
\\
with:

$\Delta \price_{t}$: is the change in price at time $\currenttime$.

$S_{t}$: is the signal value at time $\currenttime -1$.

$c$: is a constant bias.

$\kellyfraction$: is the Kelly fraction.

$\position_{\currenttime}$: is the resultant fractional portfolio investment at time \currenttime.
