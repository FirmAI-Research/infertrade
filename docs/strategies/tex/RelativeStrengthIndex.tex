\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
RSI = 100-\frac{100}{(1+RS)}
\end{equation}
\\
with:

$RSI$: is the relative strength index at $\currenttime$

$RS$: is the relative strength which is calculated using below formula.

\begin{equation}
RS = \frac{AvgU}{AvgD}
\end{equation}
\\
with:

$AvgU$ : average of all upward movements in the last $L$ price bars

$AvgD$ : average of all downward movements in the last $L$ price bars
$\L$ : Time Length
