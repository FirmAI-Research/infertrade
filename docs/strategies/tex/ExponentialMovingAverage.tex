\tblofcontents

\ruledescription{Gives a buy signal when the asset price closed above the EMA($\lookbacklength$) and gives a sell signal when the asset price closed below or lower than EMA($\lookbacklength$). The lookback length, $\lookbacklength$, determines how far back the rule looks.}

\section{Equation}
\begin{equation}
    EMA_{\currenttime} = \Big(V_{\currenttime} * \Big(\frac{S}{1 + \lookbacklength}\Big)\Big) + EMA_{\currenttime-1} * \Big(1-\frac{S}{1 + \lookbacklength}\Big)
\end{equation}
\\

where: \\

$EMA$ is exponentially weighted moving average. \\

$V_{\currenttime}$ is current stock value. \\

$\lookbacklength$ \ is look back length. \\

$S$ is the smoothing factor.
